This directory contains the Bells client code.

Please set your QTDIR environment variable to point to the Qt installation you wish to use.
It should be set to the path of the directory immediately above the bin directory.

Then add "$QTDIR/bin" to your PATH variable.

Bells uses QWebEngineView so you must choose a Qt version that supports this.
Qt5.5 is a good choice.
