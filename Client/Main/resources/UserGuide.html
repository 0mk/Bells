            "Bells" is a program to reproduce traditional 
            change-ringing, often performed on bells in church towers, 
            especially in England. For a good introduction to change-ringing, 
            see the article 
            <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ringing.org/main/pages/change-ringing" target="_top">What 
            is Change Ringing</a> on the web. This article and others it 
            links to will explain the campanological buzzwords used in this 
            manual.
          </p>

          <p>
            The program consists of two parts - the client and the 
            server. The client is the gui you see when "Bells" is 
            started. The server is the process which actually does the ringing. 
            The server is provided as a separate executable. To allow 
            flexibility, the server may be placed in the filesystem 
            independently of the client. Because of this, the client must be 
            configured to tell it the location of the server program. See 
            <a class="link" href="UserGuide-Configuration.html" title="Configuration">below</a> for details. Once properly 
            configured, the two programs perform seamlessly together as if they 
            were one.
          </p>

          <p>
            The client and server communicate via tcp/ip.
          </p>

          <p>
            The pattern of changes to be rung is known as a composition 
            and is supplied as a composition file in place-notation format. 
            Some example composition files are supplied with 
            "Bells".
          </p>

          <p>
            The server must be started by clicking the green bell button 
            and it will then read the composition file and check it for errors. 
            If all is ok, it will print the name of the first method it found 
            and wait. You must then click the yellow bell button to commence 
            ringing. You will then see the changes appear on the screen as the 
            server rings them. As well as the visual output from the server, it 
            also sends out alsa midi messages, one for each bell.

            By connecting a soft synth to the midi output, the changes can be heard. I 
            recommend using qjackctl for this purpose. You must start the 
            server before it will show up in qjackctl.
          </p>
          <p>
            The slider underneath the toolbar is used to adjust ringing speed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The method may be aborted by clicking the crossed-out yellow bell.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bobs and singles may be called interactively by clicking the 
            relevant buttons. The program automatically reverts to a plain lead 
            after the lead-end unless another call is made before the next 
            lead-end.
