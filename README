FIRST
To build, run:

make
from THIS directory.

It is possible you may need to install extra packages for the build to succeed
The build process will warn you if this is the case.

THEN
To install, run:

sudo make install
from THIS directory.

That will build everything (client, server and documentation) and then install it.


To run:

Run /usr/local/bin/bells

For help, click on the questionmark button. 

There are a few example composition files in the Compositions directory below this one.


You may also want to read the README files in the Client and Server directories

Thanks for trying out Bells. Stay tuned for future episodes.
